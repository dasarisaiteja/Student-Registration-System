# Student-Registration-System

Objective
A responsive web application to register student details (name, student ID, email ID, contact number), with functionality to view, edit, and delete records. All data is saved locally in the browser, so it persists after page reload.

Features
Register new students with validated input (no empty fields, proper formats).
View, edit, and delete records in a clear, organized table.
Real-time form validation (name: only letters; student ID: only numbers; email: proper email format; contact: at least 10 digits, only numbers).
Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Dynamic vertical scrollbar for student table when needed.
Stylish, accessible interface, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for buttons.

Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic)
CSS3 (Flexbox, Responsive Media Queries)
JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Local Storage)
Font Awesome for icons
